Has an expansive coastline that spans 2,798 kilometres, stretching along the South Atlantic and Indian Oceans. The country is bordered to the north by Namibia, Botswana, and Zimbabwe; and to the east and northeast by Mozambique and Eswatini. Pretoria is the administrative capital, while Cape Town, as the seat of Parliament, is the legislative capital. Bloemfontein has traditionally been regarded as the judicial capital. The largest city, and site of highest court is Johannesburg.\n\nBlack South Africans make up around 80% of the population. The greatest populations of European (White South Africans), Asian (Chinese and Indian South Africans), and multiracial (Coloured South Africans) ancestry make up the residual population of Africa. The diverse cultures, languages, and religions that make up South Africa's multiethnic society are numerous.\n\n## Data Source: South Africa Demographic and Health Survey\n\nThe South Africa Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) 2016 is part of Phase 7 of the DHS series: a comprehensive, nationally representative household survey series. For the 2016 South Africa DHS, 8,514 women ages 15-49 were successfully interviewed from 11,083 households.\n\nThe number of children that a woman bears depends on many factors, including the age at which she begins childbearing, the intervals between her births, and her fecundity. Postponing first births and extending the interval between births have played a role in reducing fertility levels in many Southern African countries, including South Africa. These factors also have positive health consequences. In contrast, short birth intervals (of less than 24 months) can lead to harmful outcomes for both newborns and their mothers, such as preterm birth, low birth weight, and maternal or child death. Childbearing at a very young age is associated with an increased risk of complications during pregnancy and childbirth and higher rates of neonatal mortality. This chapter describes the current level of fertility in South Africa and some of its proximate determinants. It presents information on the total fertility rate, birth intervals, insusceptibility to pregnancy (due to postpartum amenorrhoea, postpartum abstinence, or menopause), age at first birth, and teenage childbearing.\n\n## Capstone Project Objective\n\nThe objective of the capstone project is to evaluate perceptions, behaviour and practices around fertility among women aged between 15 and 49 years in South Africa. The data source for this analysis is the *2016 South Africa Demographic and Health Surveys(DHS)*. More info about the survey can be found [here](https://dhsprogram.com/data/Guide-to-DHS-Statistics/).\n\nThe data elements selected for this analysis include;\n\n-   *Respondents' age*\n\n-   *Respondents' age at 1st sex*\n\n-   *Respondents' age at 1st birth*\n\n-   *Whether currently pregnant or not*\n\n-   *Region and type of residence*\n\n-   *Highest educational level*\n\n-   *Ethnicity*\n\n-   *Wealth index*\n\n-   *Number children ever born*\n\n-   *Current marital status*\n\n# Data Analysis\n\nData analysis for this project was carried out in the R version 4.3.2.

(14.8%) Those never been in a union are drawn equally from all age groups ranging from 15 to 49. While the vast majority of those currently married are drawn for the older age groups of 30 years and above.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nIn summary, fertility varies by residence and province. The majority of women in both urban areas rural areas have at least a secondary education. Furthermore, the mean age of sexual debut differs by ethnic group. Additionally, the distribution of the ages of first birth by region are fairly similar.\n\n## References\n\n1.  [The DHS Program](https://www.dhsprogram.com/)\n\n2.

Has an expansive coastline that spans 2,798 kilometres, stretching along the South Atlantic and Indian Oceans. The country is bordered to the north by Namibia, Botswana, and Zimbabwe; and to the east and northeast by Mozambique and Eswatini. Pretoria is the administrative capital, while Cape Town, as the seat of Parliament, is the legislative capital. Bloemfontein has traditionally been regarded as the judicial capital. The largest city, and site of highest court is Johannesburg.\n\nBlack South Africans make up around 80% of the population. The greatest populations of European (White South Africans), Asian (Chinese and Indian South Africans), and multiracial (Coloured South Africans) ancestry make up the residual population of Africa. The diverse cultures, languages, and religions that make up South Africa's multiethnic society are numerous.\n\n## Data Source: South Africa Demographic and Health Survey\n\nThe South Africa Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) 2016 is part of Phase 7 of the DHS series: a comprehensive, nationally representative household survey series. For the 2016 South Africa DHS, 8,514 women ages 15-49 were successfully interviewed from 11,083 households.\n\nThe number of children that a woman bears depends on many factors, including the age at which she begins childbearing, the intervals between her births, and her fecundity. Postponing first births and extending the interval between births have played a role in reducing fertility levels in many Southern African countries, including South Africa. These factors also have positive health consequences. In contrast, short birth intervals (of less than 24 months) can lead to harmful outcomes for both newborns and their mothers, such as preterm birth, low birth weight, and maternal or child death. Childbearing at a very young age is associated with an increased risk of complications during pregnancy and childbirth and higher rates of neonatal mortality. This chapter describes the current level of fertility in South Africa and some of its proximate determinants. It presents information on the total fertility rate, birth intervals, insusceptibility to pregnancy (due to postpartum amenorrhoea, postpartum abstinence, or menopause), age at first birth, and teenage childbearing.\n\n## Capstone Project Objective\n\nThe objective of the capstone project is to evaluate perceptions, behaviour and practices around fertility among women aged between 15 and 49 years in South Africa. The data source for this analysis is the *2016 South Africa Demographic and Health Surveys(DHS)*. More info about the survey can be found [here](https://dhsprogram.com/data/Guide-to-DHS-Statistics/).\n\nThe data elements selected for this analysis include;\n\n-   *Respondents' age*\n\n-   *Respondents' age at 1st sex*\n\n-   *Respondents' age at 1st birth*\n\n-   *Whether currently pregnant or not*\n\n-   *Region and type of residence*\n\n-   *Highest educational level*\n\n-   *Ethnicity*\n\n-   *Wealth index*\n\n-   *Number children ever born*\n\n-   *Current marital status*\n\n# Data Analysis\n\nData analysis for this project was carried out in the R version 4.3.2.

Whereas the maximum age by region/province of the respondents when they had their first birth ranged from 33 years for Gauteng to 42 years for both Free State and Mpumalanga Provinces. However, mean age at first birth is very comparable across provinces. Ranging from 19.51 years for Mpumalanga to 21.17 years for Free State.\n\n### 4. The Majority of Respondents Have Never been in a Civil Union\n\n```{r sankey diagram, warning = FALSE}\nlibrary(ggsankey)\n\nir_sa_clean_sankey <- \n  ir_sa_clean %>% \n    select(age_groups,\n           marital_status,\n           urban_rural)\n\nTotalCount = nrow(ir_sa_clean_sankey)\n\n# Step 1\ndf <- ir_sa_clean_sankey %>%\n  make_long(age_groups, marital_status, urban_rural)\n\n# Step 2\ndagg <- df%>%\n  dplyr::group_by(node)%>%\n  tally()\n\ndagg <- dagg%>%\n  dplyr::group_by(node)%>%\n  dplyr::mutate(pct = n/TotalCount)\n\n\n# Step 3\ndf2 <- merge(df, dagg, by.x = 'node', by.y = 'node', all.x = TRUE)\n\npl <- ggplot(df2, aes(x = x\n                      , next_x = next_x\n                      , node = node\n                      , next_node = next_node\n                      , fill = factor(node)\n                      \n                      , label = paste0(node,\" n=\", n, '(',  round(pct* 100,1), '%)' ))\n)\n \npl <- pl +geom_sankey(flow.alpha = 0.5,  color = \"gray40\", show.legend = TRUE)\npl <- pl +geom_sankey_label(size = 3, color = \"black\", fill= \"white\", hjust = -0.1)\n\npl <- pl +  theme_bw()\npl <- pl + theme(legend.position = \"none\")\npl <- pl +  theme(axis.title = element_blank()\n                  , axis.text.y = element_blank()\n                  , axis.ticks = element_blank()  \n                  , panel.grid = element_blank())\npl <- pl + scale_fill_viridis_d(option = \"inferno\")\npl <- pl + labs(title = \"Comparing Age, Marital Status & Residence Type\")\npl <- pl + labs(fill = 'Nodes')\npl\n\n\n```\n\n**Figure 4.** Looking at the survey respondents disaggregated by age group, marital status and residence type reveals that the majority (48.9%) have never been in a union, followed by those currently married (28%) and those cohabiting with a partner. (14.8%) Those never been in a union are drawn equally from all age groups ranging from 15 to 49. While the vast majority of those currently married are drawn for the older age groups of 30 years and above.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nIn summary, fertility varies by residence and province. The majority of women in both urban areas rural areas have at least a secondary education. Furthermore, the mean age of sexual debut differs by ethnic group. Additionally, the distribution of the ages of first birth by region are fairly similar.\n\n## References\n\n1.  [The DHS Program](https://www.dhsprogram.com/)\n\n2.
