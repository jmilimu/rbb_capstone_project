Has an expansive coastline that spans 2,798 kilometres, stretching along the South Atlantic and Indian Oceans. The country is bordered to the north by Namibia, Botswana, and Zimbabwe; and to the east and northeast by Mozambique and Eswatini. Pretoria is the administrative capital, while Cape Town, as the seat of Parliament, is the legislative capital. Bloemfontein has traditionally been regarded as the judicial capital. The largest city, and site of highest court is Johannesburg.\n\nBlack South Africans make up around 80% of the population. The greatest populations of European (White South Africans), Asian (Chinese and Indian South Africans), and multiracial (Coloured South Africans) ancestry make up the residual population of Africa. The diverse cultures, languages, and religions that make up South Africa's multiethnic society are numerous.\n\n## South Africa Demographic and Health Survey (DHS)\n\nThe South Africa Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) 2016 is part of Phase 7 of the DHS series: a comprehensive, nationally representative household survey series. For the 2016 South Africa DHS, 8,514 women ages 15-49 were successfully interviewed from 11,083 households.\n\nThe number of children that a woman bears depends on many factors, including the age at which she begins childbearing, the intervals between her births, and her fecundity. Postponing first births and extending the interval between births have played a role in reducing fertility levels in many Southern African countries, including South Africa. These factors also have positive health consequences. In contrast, short birth intervals (of less than 24 months) can lead to harmful outcomes for both newborns and their mothers, such as preterm birth, low birth weight, and maternal or child death. Childbearing at a very young age is associated with an increased risk of complications during pregnancy and childbirth and higher rates of neonatal mortality. This chapter describes the current level of fertility in South Africa and some of its proximate determinants. It presents information on the total fertility rate, birth intervals, insusceptibility to pregnancy (due to postpartum amenorrhoea, postpartum abstinence, or menopause), age at first birth, and teenage childbearing.\n\nThe objective of the capstone project is to evaluate perceptions and behaviour around fertility among women aged between 15 and 49 years in South Africa. The data source for this analysis is the *2016 South Africa Demographic and Health Surveys(DHS)*.
